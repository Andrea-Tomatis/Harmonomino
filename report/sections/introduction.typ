The game tetris popculture icon -> mathametical puzzle showing ...

Questions:

1. Can a heuristic approach converge to a "optimal" solutions that reaches the theoretical maximum
  tetris score.
2. Is hsa or ce "better"?
3. Can we characterize the solution space of weights for the tetris agent? -> No, uniform.


What are Stachastic Local Search Heurisctics?


// NOTE: maybe literature in seperate section?
